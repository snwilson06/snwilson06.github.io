					  Focus</u></b></font></span><br>
<font size="3">  My research interests lie in mathematical problems
					  with applications in
					  Neuroscience, Oncology, and
					  Evolutionary Biology. More
					  specifically, I use the
					  techniques of parameter
					  estimation, machine
					  learning, dynamical systems
					  and network theory to create
					  models of biological
					  phenomenon (e.g. cancer
					  growth, sleep dynamics,
					  cellular immune
					  dynamics). My current
					  research program facilitates
					  truly interdisciplinary
					  collaboration spanning a
					  number of subject areas
					  including mathematics,
					  computer science, physics,
					  engineering, evolutionary
					  biology, and
					  oncology.</font>

					  size="3">
					   <center> <img src="ecto_figure.png" alt="Ectoparasites" width="400"></center>

					  Here, we
					  seek to understand how
					  social systems evolve under
					  a careful balancing act
					  between living in
					  collaborative groups that
					  can accomplish complex tasks
					  and avoiding patterns in
					  social contact that would
					  amplify the risks of
					  infection transmission.

					  We are developing and
					  analyzing the mathematical
					  systems needed to understand
					  the interplay between
					  sociality and ectoparasitic (parasites that live external to their host) infections.
A number of models have investigated how organizational structure can emerge from individual behavioral dynamics. The effects of these dynamics are explored through models of social network theory where mathematical metrics are used to quantify the relative importance of nodes and the organization of the network. Network centrality theory is used to identify the most important individuals in a social network as well as to characterize the properties of the network as a whole. Within this context, our main focus for this project centers around characterizing the link between parasite load and sociality in dynamic networks. We aim to capture the key elements of these social systems in two ways : 1) using a system of differential equations; 2) via agent-based simulations.

					  Effects on Rem/non-Rem Sleep
					  Dynamics</u></b></font></span><br><font

<center> <img src="sleep_figure.png" alt="Sleep Model" width="400"></center>

					  Sleep is a behavioral state
					  in which we spend nearly one
					  third of our lives. This
					  biological phenomenon
					  clearly serves an important
					  role in the lives of most
					  species. While much effort
					  has been put forth in
					  understanding the nature of
					  sleep, many aspects of sleep
					  are still not well
					  understood.  Mathematical models of sleep often neglect temperature properties and
					  the effects of temperature
					  on sleep, as they pose
					  additional complexities to
					  the already-intricate nature
					  of sleep. However, if it is
					  believed that temperature
					  plays a key role in both the
					  quality and quantity of
					  human sleep, then including
					  temperature as a model
					  feature is imperative. Thus,
					  we have developed a
					  mathematical model that
					  incorporates this key
					  component and its effects on
					  sleep, so that we may better
describe and understand the mechanisms underlying sleep behavior when
thermoregulation plays a role. We have developed a system of
nonlinear, Morris-Lecar type, ordinary differential equations that
model human sleepwake regulation with thermoregulation and temperature
effects. Our results show that incorporating a biologically inspired
representation of thermoregulation in a mathematical model for human
sleep/wake cycling can account for several features observed in
experimental data. Analysis of the model provides a more detailed
understanding of the underlying mathematical mechanisms associated
with sleep. We find that temperature effects could provide a crucial
component of mathematical models of human sleep/wake cycling.

					  My postdoctoral

					  <a
					  href="http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/~numed/">NUMED
					  Team</a> of 
		<a href="http://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble"> INRIA Grenoble - Rh&ocircne-Alpes</a>.  Here, we use longitudinal murine tumor growth data
					  to develop nonlinear,
					  mixed-effect, ODE models to
					  study the effects of combined
					  anti-angiogenic and
					  chemotherapeutic treatments.
Upon model validation, we run numerical experiments to determine
					  optimal treatment protocols
					  for the administration of
					  anti-angiogenics and
					  chemotherapy. The results of
					  these theoretical
					  experiments are then
					  followed up with biological
					  studies to determine the
					  effectiveness of the
					  theoretically obtained
					  protocols.
